				<h4> Mohinga </h4>
				<p> A comforting noodle soup considered one of the national dishes of Burma. The hot and sour fish based broth is poured over noodles in generous bowls. The recipe includes intense aromatic ingredients such as lemongrass, chilli and shrimp paste. Often served at breakfast but also sold throughout the day by restaurants, tea houses and street vendors.

				<h4> Coconut Milk Noodles </h4>
				<p> Mohinga (fish noodle soup) may be the national dish in Myanmar, but the comforting ohn-no khaut swe is just as loved. Its name, translating to "coconut milk noodles", points out its decidedly coconut flavour. The key to this simple dish is in the toppings and condiments, which are added according to personal preference for additional flavour, spice and texture. (Credit: www.sbs.com) </p>

				<h4> Pork Curry </h4>
				<p> Sipyan, the Burmese word for curry, means ‘oil returns’, and refers to how the curry is cooked until the oil comes back to the surface. Oil adds a juicy texture to pork. Pork Curry can be creatively cooked with other additional sauce such as tamarind sauce. Burmese curry dishes usually lean more towards spicy sauce and gravy. Some Burmese pork curry dishes include vegetables such as sour bamboo shoots. In Burmese curry, the chilli powder and spices play an important role in creating an authentic flavor.(Credit: www.sbs.com) </p>

				<img alt="Entree" src=images/mango.jpg />
				<h4> Spiced Pork with Green Mango </h4>
				<p> Appearing widely in our research for this dish, the following rhyme is a neat summary of Burmese cookery: ‘Of all the fruit, the mango is best; of all the meat, pork is best; and of all the leaves, lahpet’s (fermented tea leaf) the best.’ Mango is used in this pork curry to add flavour and to help tenderise the meat, while shredded green mango also makes a piquant accompaniment as a salad. Often flavoured with ground dried shrimp, shrimp paste and fish sauce, it provides a wonderfully salty-sour counterpoint to the rich pork. (Credit: www.sbs.com) </p>
