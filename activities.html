		<h2> Festivals and Activities in Myanmar </h2> 
		<p> Buddhist festivals fall all year round in Myanmar and usually coincide with the full moon. There are also many festivals that are specific to particular villages or temples. Temple fairs or pagoda festivals, lasting a week or longer, are the equivalent of western fun fairs, with entertainers, magicians, puppeteers, musicians, clairvoyants, healers and patent medicine purveyors moving from one fair to the next bringing excitement, colour and a much-earned break to the lives of local people. </p>

		<p>Spirit festivals, known as Nat Pwes, whilst having only a tacit connection to Buddhism, have equal significance and share a tendency to coincide with the full moon. Major festivals fall during March,Buddhist Lent (July-September) and December. (Credit: www.visit-mekong.com)</p> <br>

				<img alt="Thingyan" src=images/thingyan.jpg />
				<p>This Thingyan Festival falls in April, the summer time of Myanmar. Celebrating the Myanmar New Year, this festival lasts for several days and is marked by major, good-natured water throwing. Water Festival is meant to cleanse last year's sins and start a fresh new year ahead. It is also a time of merit making, and older people go to temples for prayer and alms giving.

Marking the end of Buddhist Lent, this festival, held on the full moon day of Thadingyut, lasts for three days during which houses and streets are festively decorated and illuminated. People crowd into their local pagodas to offer alms and make merit. Younger people also pay homage to their parents, elders and teachers. (Credit: www.visit-mekong.com)
