		<p> Between the 9th and 13th centuries, Bagan (née Pagan), was the capital of the Kingdom of Pagan, once a tiny settlement that eventually gained power and, in doing so, united the neighboring territories to form Burma, present-day Myanmar. The 11th through mid-13th centuries were the height of the Kingdom of Pagan's prosperity, and it was during those 250 years that the then-10,000 stupas, temples, and pagodas were built. Today, just 2,000 remain, but their expanse is staggering. Bikes can be hired from every guesthouse for around K2,500, and visitors will find that on two wheels is the best way to get around. The stupas dot the sides of the long road that runs through Bagan, and the awe-inspiring larger temples are clustered across from Tharabar (née Tharbha) Gate, the only surviving section of Bagan's city wall. There are so many small stupas on either side of the road leading up to the larger temples that it's entirely possible to be completely alone and surrounded by hundreds of them. If your time in Myanmar is limited, skip Mandalay and head to Bagan, permeated by a laid-back, backpacker-style vibe. (Credit: Fodor's Travel)</p>

		<h3> Mandalay </h3>

		<p>Myanmar's second largest city and its last royal capital, Mandalay is home to the rebuilt Mandalay Palace; the original, destroyed during WWII, was home to then-Burma's last monarchy. Downtown Mandalay is heavy on the concrete and urban sprawl; unlike Yangon, it looks nothing like it did when it was part British Burma. Mandalay is laid out on a grid, and from 35th St. north to the citadel walls can be easily traversed on foot or by bicycle. Bikes can be hired from your hotel for around $3 per hour. Mandalay offers a sharp contrast to Yangon and is interesting taken from both a historical and an urban planning point of view. A further juxtaposition to the big, dusty city is its nearby hill station Pyin U Lwin (née Maymo). Here is where Upper Burma's strongest colonial legacy lies, in the form of manicured gardens, horse-drawn carriages, and homes straight out of the English countryside. (Credit: Fodor's Travel)</p>

		<p>Not for die-hard urbanites, tranquil Inle Lake is where visitors come to decompress after hot, dusty tours through the rest of the country's must-see spots. Myanmar's second-largest lake, Inle is located in Nyaung Shwe Township in Myanmar's Shan State, which borders China to the north, Laos to the east, and Thailand to the south. It's estimated that the country has some 100 ethnic groups, and most of the people living on and around the lake are Intha; they are self-sufficient farmers and practice a unique form of paddling called leg-rowing. It's the tiny village of Nyaung Shwe to which visitors arrive from, and depart for, the airport. Like Bagan's towns, it has evolved to cater to tourists. The activity of choice here is boating, floating around the lake on wooden canoes fitted with outboard motors. Diminutive wooden huts on stilts rise up from the water as women do their washing and kids run from one dwelling to the next. Following sunset, the lake quickly quiets, with just the faint whirring of motors as the last boatmen retire for the day. (Credit: Fodor's Travel)</p>

		<p> A former capital city, Yangon can provide lots of modern, urban attraction while still maintaining old traditions. You can still observe buildings from British Colony time in downtown Yangon. Shwe Dagon Pagoda on the left is an all-time tourist attraction with its glorious golden reflection at night. Karaweik palace on the right portrays ancient Burmese architecture as a golden palace residing in the water. </p>
